download and install packages and dependencies|||
Install downloads and installs the packages named by the import paths,
along with their dependencies.

This command works even you haven't installed any version control tool
such as git, hg, etc.

The install flags are:

	-p
		pure download packages without version control.
	-c

	-d
		download without installing packages.
	-u
		force to update pakcages.
	-e
		download dependencies for examples.

The list flags accept a space-separated list of strings. To embed spaces
in an element in the list, surround it with either single or double quotes.
