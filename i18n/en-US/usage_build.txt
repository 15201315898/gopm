compile and install packages and dependencies|||
Build compiles and installs the packages named by the import paths,
along with their dependencies.

If the package is main, the output file
name is the base name of the containing directory.

The build flags are shared by the build and test commands:

	-v
		print the names of packages as they are compiled.
	-r
		run program after built.

The list flags accept a space-separated list of strings.

For more about specifying packages, see 'go help packages'.

See also: gpm install.
