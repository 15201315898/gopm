compile and install packages and dependencies|||
Build compiles and installs the packages named by the import paths,
along with their dependencies.

If the arguments are a list of .go files, build treats them as a list
of source files specifying a single package.

When the command line specifies a single main package,
build writes the resulting executable to output.
Otherwise build compiles the packages but discards the results,
serving only as a check that the packages can be built.

If the package is main, the output file
name is the base name of the containing directory.

The build flags are shared by the build and test commands:

	-v
		print the names of packages as they are compiled.
	-r
		run program after built.

The list flags accept a space-separated list of strings. To embed spaces
in an element in the list, surround it with either single or double quotes.

For more about specifying packages, see 'go help packages'.
